# Fake_News_Classification_Basic

## The project is a basic usage of an online Machine Learning algorithm, in the project I have used a Passive Aggressive Classifier machine learning algorithm to classify the news as Real or Fake.

## Explanation of why this algorithm is used for this typr of data, beacuse we have to take aggressive steps on the fake news, because it might affect someothers on social media, so we have to use an algorithm which takes aggressive steps in updating the parameters when a wrong classification is made! This is an example of an NLP project where tfidf vectorizer is used for the feature extraction from the tweets!

## Use the news.zip file for the data, if it fails... Download from this google drive link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1er9NJTLUA3qnRuyhfzuN0XUsoIC4a-_q/view
